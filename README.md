This project is currently a work in progress. In this project I scrape data from popular recipe website "allrecipes.com" to obtain recipe names, ingredient lists, and reviews. 
Currently, I am only extracting cake recipes and am figuring out how to have the script wait until a new page loads to continue to extract recipes.
